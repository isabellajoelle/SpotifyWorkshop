# SpotifyWorkshop

Hi hi! 

This was a workshop I created during my time in Stevens Women in Computer Science (SWiCS) to familiarize our members with the Spotify Developer Portal. 

It is a track analyzer that will take in a song name and/or artist name and spit out the metrics Spotify uses to classify it like Dancebility, Acousticness, Liveness, etc.

# Using this Project

1. Create a Spotify Developer Portal Account if you don't have one already
2. Create a new project titled "Track Analyzer" and copy its client id and client secret
3. Paste the client id and client secret in their respective variables in the .env file
4. Run "python3 dashFrontend.py" in your terminal
5. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8050/ and type in your favorite song :)
